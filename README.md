### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Command" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
This example is based on the combat system of the Pokemon videogames saga. In this example you can visualize that each action of the combat system of the Pokemon (Attack, Escape and Heal), are implemented in an specific class. This class can be accesed by multiple way, alowing you use each command from all the ways that you want.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Command/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Command/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
